# Northcoders News App Instructions

## To use this Web App: 
https://elir-nc-news.netlify.app/
* Please be patient with the app as the API being used hosting instance will spin down with inactivity, which can delay requests by 50 seconds or more
* Please do let me know if you find any areas of improvement I am very happy to receive feedback

## Project summary:
* This is a frontend project creating a web app to display news articles and all of their details. With functionality for users to vote on articles, leave comments and sort the articles in many different ways
* Created as part of my Northcoders 13 week software development bootcamp journey using skills learnt over the first 9 weeks
* Was initially completed in 5 days - however I will be refactoring some already known improvements in the coming weeks
